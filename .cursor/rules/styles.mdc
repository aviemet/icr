- DO NOT USE TAILWIND.
- This project uses Mantine as a component library.
- CSS is written using CSS modules with Linaria. CSS is written in separate files with a `css.ts` extension.
- CSS is imported into React components using `import * as classes from (filename).css`. It should always be accompanied by `import cx from clsx` and referencing classes should always use `cx`.
- Mantine CSS variables are exported using Mantine's `themeToVars` which converts the base Mantine theme object into CSS variables.
- Each css.ts file starts with the following imports:
	`import { css } from "@linaria/core"`
	`import { vass } from "@/lib"`
- Styles in css.ts files are built using the `css` function with string template literals.
