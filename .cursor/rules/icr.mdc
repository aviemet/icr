# REQUIRED FOR EVERY INTERACTION:

1. Read .cursor/icr.mdx at the start of each interaction
2. Before ending ANY response, if you've learned anything useful about project-specific architectural details that are NOT immediately obvious from reading the code, you MUST update .cursor/icr.mdx with this information
3. When updating .cursor/icr.mdx:
   - ONLY document project-specific architectural decisions, custom patterns, and *non-obvious* implementation details
   - Only add new information not already documented
   - Place information in the appropriate section, if no appropriate section exists, create one
