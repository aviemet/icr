# REQUIRED FOR EVERY INTERACTION:

1. Read .cursor/icr.mdx at the start of each interaction
2. Before ending ANY response, if you've learned anything useful about project-specific architectural details that are NOT immediately obvious from reading the code, you MUST update .cursor/icr.mdx with this information
3. When updating .cursor/icr.mdx:
   - Only document reusable, cross-cutting patterns; skip single-file or one-off implementation notes that are obvious from code
   - Only add new information not already documented
   - Place information in the appropriate section, if no appropriate section exists, create one
