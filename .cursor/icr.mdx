## Conventions
### Architecture
- Single-tenant application
- Company settings use singleton pattern

### Development Guidelines
- No multi-tenancy support
- Changes must be atomic and focused
- TypeScript is used for all JavaScript code
  - Start with most restrictive type definitions
  - Avoid `any`, `unknown`, and type casting with `as`
  - Prefer existing type definitions and interfaces
  - Use generics, Records, and Mapped types before inline types
  - Type assertions are a last resort

## Feature Documentation
*Document completed features and their core functionality here*

### Permission System
The permission system provides fine-grained access control with support for complex conditions:

#### Components
- **Permission Groups**: Define sets of permissions with effects (allow/deny) and conditions
- **Permission Assignments**: Link permission groups to users or job titles with optional time restrictions
- **Permission Resolution**: Evaluates permissions based on precedence levels and conditions

#### Key Features
- **Precedence Levels**: Higher precedence permissions override lower ones
- **Explicit Allow/Deny**: At each precedence level, deny takes priority over allow
- **Conditional Access**: Supports conditions like:
  - Owner-only access (user must own the record)
  - Time-restricted access (only valid during specific time windows)
  - Custom conditions (extensible for specific needs)

#### Usage
```ruby
# Creating a permission group
permission_group = Permission::Group.create!(
  name: "Time-restricted View",
  description: "Allow viewing during business hours",
  permissions: [{
    resource: "clients",
    action: "view",
    effect: "allow",
    conditions: {
      time_restricted: {
        start_time: "09:00",
        end_time: "17:00"
      }
    }
  }]
)

# Assigning permissions
Permission::Assignment.create!(
  permissionable: user,
  group: permission_group,
  starts_at: Time.current
)

# Checking permissions
user.permission?("clients", "view", context)
```

## Technical Decisions
### Authentication & Authorization
- Using Devise for authentication
- Using Pundit for authorization policies
- Using Rolify for role management
- Authorization enforced at both API and UI levels
- Fine-grained permissions through custom permission system
  - Supports complex conditions (time-based, owner-only)
  - Hierarchical with precedence levels
  - Polymorphic assignments (users, job titles)

### Document Management
- Documents will be stored using Active Storage
- Version control will be maintained for important documents
- Access control will be managed through Pundit policies

### Calendar System
- Calendar must support multiple view strategies
- Events must handle timezone conversions properly
- Recurring events must follow RFC 5545 (iCalendar) specification

### Timesheet System
- Timesheets will be generated per pay period
- System will maintain audit trail of all changes
- Approval workflow will be multi-step

### Frontend Architecture
#### Component Structure
- Frontend code organized in `/app/frontend`:
  - `/components`: Reusable, general-purpose components
  - `/features`: Feature-specific components
  - `/layouts`: Layout components
  - `/lib`: Non-React code and utilities
  - `/pages`: Top-level Inertia pages (entry points for routes)
  - `/queries`: Async react-query methods
  - `/types`: Global types and interfaces

#### UI & Styling
- Mantine component library
- CSS modules with Linaria
  - Files use `.css.ts` extension
  - Imports as `import * as classes from './file.css'`
  - Class composition with `clsx`
- Dark/light theme support via Mantine theme system

#### Form Implementation
- Built on `use-inertia-form` v4.6.0
- Form component wraps Inertia form with Mantine UI
- Supports nested data through `NestedObject` type
- Rails-compatible form attributes by default
- Custom inputs use `useInertiaInput` hook
- Form state includes processing, errors, validation, and dirty tracking
- All components strictly typed with `BaseFormInputProps<T>` interface

#### State Management
- Server state: Inertia.js
- Client-only state: zustand
- Form state: use-inertia-form

#### Type System
- Strict TypeScript throughout
- No use of `any`, `unknown`, or type casting with `as`
- Prefer existing type definitions and interfaces
- Use generics, Records, and Mapped types before inline types
- Type assertions as last resort
- Auto-generated types for serializers

#### Internationalization (i18n)
- Using react-i18next for frontend translations
- Translation files from i18n-js gem
- Translations in Rails locales (yml)
- Full i18n support (numbers, dates, currency, RTL)
- Translation organization:
  - Model-specific translations in `config/locales/[model]/frontend.en.yml`
  - Other frontend translations in `config/locales/frontend.en.yml`
  - Frontend key structure:
    - `views.[feature].[page].[key]` (e.g., `views.clients.index.title`)
    - Common elements are shared within their feature namespace (e.g., `views.devise.shared.email`)
- Common notice templates in `en.yml` under `templates.controllers.notices`
  - Reusable patterns for CRUD operations
  - Uses `%{model}` interpolation
  - Can be extended in model-specific locale files
- Controller notice messages use standard templates:
  - Created: `t("templates.controllers.notices.created", model: "Model Name")`
  - Updated: `t("templates.controllers.notices.updated", model: "Model Name")`
  - Destroyed: `t("templates.controllers.notices.destroyed", model: "Model Name")`
  - Status Updated: `t("templates.controllers.notices.status_updated", model: "Model Name")`

#### Testing
- Unit: Vitest + React Testing Library
- E2E: Playwright (no mocks, uses test environment)
- Test files mirror source structure in `/app/frontend/tests`

#### Performance
- Component code splitting
- Route-based lazy loading
- Image optimization
- Proper useEffect cleanup
- Memoized expensive computations
- Minimal global state
